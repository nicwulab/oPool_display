## Introduction
oPool<sup>+</sup> display combines oligo pool synthesis and mRNA display to construct and characterize the specificity of many natively paired antibodies in parallel. As a proof-of-concept, we applied oPool<sup>+</sup> display to rapidly screen the binding activity of >300 previously uncharacterized influenza hemagglutinin (HA) antibodies against the conserved HA stem domain. This repository, therefore, contains two parts: 1. the oligo sequence desgins for library assmebly and 2. the screening result and analyses.

## Environment setup

```bash
conda env create -f environment.yml
```
## Oligo pool seqeunce design

Please proceed to the [oPoolPrimer](oPoolPrimer/) folder

## Screening and experimental data analyses
