# oPool<sup>+</sup> display: a rapid and cost effective *in vitro* natively paired antibody screening platform
This README describe the design and analyses in manuscript: Rapid synthesis and screening of natively paired antibodies against influenza hemagglutinin stem using oPool<sup>+</sup> display.

oPool<sup>+</sup> display combines oligo pool synthesis and mRNA display to construct and characterize the specificity of many natively paired antibodies in parallel. As a proof-of-concept, we applied oPool<sup>+</sup> display to rapidly screen the binding activity of >300 previously uncharacterized influenza hemagglutinin (HA) antibodies against the conserved HA stem domain
